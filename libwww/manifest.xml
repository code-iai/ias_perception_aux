  libwww is a highly modular, general-purpose client side Web API written in C
  for Unix and Windows (Win32). It's well suited for both small and large
  applications, like browser/editors, robots, batch tools, etc. Pluggable
  modules provided with libwww include complete HTTP/1.1 (with caching,
  pipelining, PUT, POST, Digest Authentication, deflate, etc), MySQL logging,
  FTP, HTML/4, XML (expat), RDF (SiRPAC), WebDAV, and much more. The purpose
  of libwww is to serve as a testbed for protocol experiments.
